- Java has 8 built in primitive types. These are the most basic building blocks for storing values. Here's a quick overview.
  - byte
    - 8- bit signed (it means starts from -2 billion to 2 billion) integer
    - Range: -128 to 127
    - Use when you need a small range of numbers to save memory (rare in modern apps)
