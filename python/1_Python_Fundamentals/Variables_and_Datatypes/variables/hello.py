# Question 1 (Variables & Print)Create these five variables (with the exact values shown) and then print them all in a single print call so they appear on one line separated by spaces:

age = 25
price = 19.99
name = "Abel"
is_student = False
empty = None

print(age, price, name, is_student, empty)

# Simpler/correct options (choose one)
# Let print do the spacing:
# print(age, price, name, is_student, empty)
# Use an f-string:
# print(f"{age} {price} {name} {is_student} {empty}")
# Or explicitly set sep (defaults to a single space anyway):
# print(age, price, name, is_student, empty, sep=" ")

print("-------------------------------------------------------------")

# Question 2 (Type inspection)Using the same variables you created (age, price, name, is_student, empty), print their types in a single print call so the console shows exactly this line:
