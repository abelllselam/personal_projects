**Data Structure and Algorithm**

- Here’s a roadmap for mastering data structures & algorithms in bite-sized, hands-on modules. We’ll go step-by-step—you’ll get one focused lesson at a time with examples, exercises, and clear “why” explanations before we move on.

1. Algorithmic Thinking & Complexity

   - Big-O, Θ, Ω notation
   - Time vs. space trade-offs
   - Amortized analysis

2. Linear Structures

   - Arrays & Strings: indexing, slicing, common operations
   - Linked Lists: singly, doubly, circular; insertion/deletion

3. Stacks & Queues

   - LIFO/FIFO principles
   - Implementations with arrays/linked lists
   - Use cases (e.g. expression evaluation, sliding-window problems)

4. Recursion & Divide-and-Conquer

   - Recursion patterns
   - Master theorem
   - Examples: binary search, merge sort, quick sort

5. Trees & Heaps

   - Binary trees, binary search trees (BST)
   - Tree traversals (in/pre/post)
   - Heaps & priority queues, heapify

6. Hashing & Hash Tables

   - Hash functions, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing)
   - Implementing maps/sets
   - Real-world applications

7. Graphs

   - Representations (adjacency list/matrix)
   - Traversals (DFS, BFS)
   - Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
   - Minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim)

8. Sorting & Searching

   - Comparison sorts (insertion, bubble, selection, heap, merge, quick)
   - Non-comparison sorts (counting, radix)
   - Binary search variations

9. Advanced Paradigms

   - Greedy algorithms
   - Dynamic programming & memoization
   - Backtracking

10. Designing & Analyzing Complex Structures

    - Tries, suffix trees/arrays
    - Segment trees, Fenwick (BIT) trees
    - Disjoint set union (union-find)

11. Putting It All Together
    - Algorithm design patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, divide-and-conquer)
    - Problem-solving strategies & leetcode-style practice plans
