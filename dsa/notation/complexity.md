**Algorithm thinking & Complexity**

# What is Complexity:

- Complexity measures how an algorithm work grows as the input size (n) grows.
- Two main resources: Time (how many steps) and space (how much extra memory).
- You can think of time, like how many moves it will take you to finish a puzzle; space as how many extra pieces or bins you need while you work.
- The time complexity tells us how the number of steps an algorithm takes grows as the input size n increases. A step is a basic operation like a comparison (if) an assignment or an arithmetic operation.
- The reason we count steps is that even though computers are fast, if your steps grow too quickly even billions of operations per-second wont save you when n is large.
- counting steps give a machine-independent way to compare how efficient different algorithms are.
