**What is an Algorithm**

- An algorithm can be thought of as a recipe that can be followed. For instance it could be a set of instructions to follow to build a tower of blocks.
  - step 1: Pick up a block.
  - step 2: place it on top of the tower.
  - step 3: Repeat until the tower is as tall as you want.
- So the little recipe is an algorithm - just a list of steps you follow to get something done.
- Why does it matter, computers need clear unambiguous recipes to do their work - just like you need clear steps to build your block tower.

**What is a data structure**

- Data structure is how we store and how each piece connect or relate for quick operation and measures how fast you can do it. While, algorithm is how you can follow instructions to work with those pieces.
- Data structure is a way to store and organize data. It defines how elements connect (arrays index by position; linked lists chain by pointers; trees link parent↔child; hash tables map keys↔values). It matters because it determines which operations are fast. While algorithm is steps to solve a problem or perform a task using those structures. It works by describing how you traverse, compare, combine, modify data (e.g., searching a list, sorting an array, traversing a tree). The same problem may have many algorithms; you choose/design that works efficiently with your chosen data structure.
